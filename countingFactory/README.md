## GMDIBot: Counting
This counting system was inspired by JonathanGD idea.

## How does it work?
When the owner/some dedicated member also counting or even chatting in the specified channel, the counter resets to zero. <br>
Simple as that.

## Rules
- Do not delete or even modify the previous counting (sort-of message)
- Do not override the current counting.
- Only count one time per user.
- Your start point is zero, not one.
- If it's wrong, you have __two out of three__ chances to follow the counter.
- If you waste your three chances to follow the counter, the counter resets to zero.
- If the counter is reset, you have 30 seconds for preparation. In other word, cooldown.
> Disobeying the rules may resets the counter back to zero.
