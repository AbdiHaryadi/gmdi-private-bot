## Side-Project (GMDI Discord Bot, Freedom Rebase)
An advanced private Discord Bot, made for Geometry Dash Indonesia.
Built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

## Purposes
One of our reckless server moderator is often being overreactive. <br>
This repo branch is intended to make the Discord server even more strict, therefore creating an uncomfortable environment for the server members. <br>
Well, if you all really care about kids on Discord, who cares? It's internet, it's their choice.
